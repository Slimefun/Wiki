The Electric Press is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which presses items into different forms.

It's an automated version of the [Compressor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Compressor) but it has a better yield rate.
It also has a far larger amount of recipes, most of them press resources into their block forms.  
If you want to know all the recipes, just open the machine's page in the Slimefun guide.
