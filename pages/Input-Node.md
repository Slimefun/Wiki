An Input Node is the component of a [cargo network](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) which filters and distributes items to be received by [output nodes](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Node) (or [advanced output nodes](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Advanced-Output-Node)).

## Obtaining
Input nodes can be crafted in groups of two in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
Input nodes move items from the container on which they are placed into the network, as long as there is an available matching output node in the network. Specifically, every SF tick, the input node attempts to move the first matching item in the container.

### Placement
A cargo input node must be placed (shift-right click) onto a container or [machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines), and aligned within 6 blocks of a [cargo manager](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Manager) or a [connector](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Connector-Node) in range of one (no diagonals).

### Configuration
Right-clicking an input node displays an interface to configure the following settings, from left to right:
* **3x3 grid** - Items placed there are included/excluded from being sent into the network.
* **Type: Whitelist/Blacklist** - Controls whether the items in the grid are whitelisted (included) or blacklisted (excluded).
* **Include Sub-IDs/Durability** - If enabled, only the items with the same durability as the ones in the grid will be whitelisted/blacklisted.
* **Round-Robin Mode** - If enabled, items will be distributed equally on the channel.
* **Include Lore** - If enabled, only the items with the same lore as the ones in the grid will be whitelisted/blacklisted.
* **Channel** - The channel in which items are sent.
