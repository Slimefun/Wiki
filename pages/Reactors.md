Reactors are a way to [Generate Energy](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) fast and efficiently.  
There are currently two types of Reactors. Both of these require to be surrounded by water.

## Reactor Access Port
The Reactor Access Port can be found in the [Cargo Management](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management) category.  
It has to be placed exactly 3 blocks above the reactor and it can be used to interact with the Reactor from the outside.  
This provides an easy way to add Fuel/Coolant or take some of the byproduct.

## Reactor Types
| Type                | Power  | Buffer | Fuel                                | Cooling                  | Side Effects                 |
| :------------------ | :----: | :----: | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Nuclear Reactor     | 16 J/s |  1.0x  | Neptunium, Uranium, Boosted Uranium | Reactor Coolant Cells    | N/A                          |
| Nether Star Reactor | 40 J/s |  3.0x  | Nether Stars                        | Nether Ice Coolant Cells | Nearby Entities get Withered |

## Example Setup
![Reactor Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/multiblock-reactor.png)  
In the center you see the Reactor, surrounded by water. Three blocks north you can see the Reactor Access Port.

**Note:** The quartz and glass blocks are entirely there for decoration (and to keep the water from spilling), they're not necessary for the setup.
