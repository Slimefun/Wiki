The Soulbound Rune is a [Magical Item](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) in Slimefun.<br>
The rune prevents the item it is used on from being dropped upon death, similarly to [Soulbound armor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Armor), [tools](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Tools) and [weapons](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Weapons).

## Usage
You can bind an item to your soul by dropping it, and then dropping a Soulbound Rune next to it.<br>
This will prevent the bound item from being dropped when you die. This consumes the rune, so make sure to use it on the right item.<br>
You can tell an item is Soulbound when it has the "Soulbound" lore under its name.
