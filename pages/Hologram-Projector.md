The Hologram Projector is part of the [Technical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Technical-Gadgets) category.  
It is not required to power these machines for them to be able to run.

With the Hologram Projector you can display custom text, color codes are supported.  
You're also able to offset the hologram without limit, so it is fun and useful to use.
