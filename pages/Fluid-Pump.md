The Fluid Pump is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which collects contiguous lava and water source blocks in a "vein".
The machine will continue to collect lava and water as long as it is powered and supplied with buckets and as long as there are source blocks remaining within 42 blocks' distance.
By building a system to replenish the source, this can be used to obtain an infinite source of both water and lava, which can be very useful.

## FLuid Pump Tiers
There is currently only one tier of the Fluid Pump.

**Power Usage**: 32/J per action
