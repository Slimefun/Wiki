The GPS Transmitter is a basic component of a GPS network, which is a building block of the [GPS](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/GPS) category.

## Obtaining
The GPS Transmitters can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage and mechanics
The GPS Transmitter adds GPS network complexity equal to `TierModifier * Height + TierBonus`, based on the tier of the Transmitter and its Y-coordinate.

## Tiers
The table below describes differences between tiers of Transmitters.

| Tier | Buffer | Consumption | Tier Modifier | Tier Bonus |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| GPS Transmitter | 16 J | 2 J/s | 1 | 0 |
