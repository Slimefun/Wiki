![Different stages of an energy capacitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/item-capacitor.gif)

Energy Capacitors are [Electric Components](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which can store and transfer energy in an energy network.  
There are five "tiers" of capacitors, each with an increasing capacity.

## Obtaining
All six tiers of energy capacitors can be crafted in an [Enchanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
An energy capacitor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#Machines), [Energy Generator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#Energy-generation), [Energy Regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator), or another capacitor (in a straight line; no diagonals).

They transfer energy between blocks in that range, so they can be used to extend your network.  
They will also store excess energy indefinitely, unless they are broken or the energy is used up.

A Capacitor's side texture will change depending on how much energy is stored in it, but you can more accurately measure it with a [Multimeter](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Technical-Gadgets#multimeter).

## Capacity
Each tier of energy capacitor has a different capacity, listed below.

| Item                             | Capacity |
| :------------------------------- | :------: |
| Small Energy Capacitor           | 128 J    |
| Medium Energy Capacitor          | 512 J    |
| Big Energy Capacitor             | 1024 J   |
| Large Energy Capacitor           | 8192 J   |
| Carbonado Edged Energy Capacitor | 65536 J  |
| Energized Energy Capacitor       | 524288 J |
