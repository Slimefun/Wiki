Soulbound Weapons are a subcategory of the [Weapons](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Weapons) category.  
The three weapons which can be soulbound are the Soulbound Sword, Soulbound Trident, and the Soulbound Bow. As the name implies, they will remain in your Inventory even if you die.  

They are an unenchanted Diamond Sword, Trident and a Bow, respectively, and may be enchanted like any other weapon.
