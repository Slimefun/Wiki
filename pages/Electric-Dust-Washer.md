The Electric Dust Washer is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which obtains [Dusts](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore).

It's the electric version of the [Ore Washer](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer), only it does not generate by-products and thus improves the yield rate.

## Tip

Seeing as sifted ore can produce many different dusts, it is recommended to hook it up to a cargo system because it only has 2 output slots and they will fill pretty quickly.
