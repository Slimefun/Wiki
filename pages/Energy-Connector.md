The Energy Connector is an [Electric Component](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which can transfer energy in an Energy Network. Unlike an [Energy Capacitor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitors), it has no buffer.  

## Usage
An energy capacitor must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#Machines), [Energy Generator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#Energy-generation), [Energy Regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator), or another capacitor (in a straight line; no diagonals).

They transfer energy between blocks in that range, so they can be used to extend your network.
