Neptunium is a [Resource](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Resources) that can be used to power [Nuclear Reactors](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#energy-generation) or to create better even better radioactive fuels.

## Obtaining
Neptunium is a byproduct of using [Uranium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Uranium) as a fuel for [Nuclear Reactors](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#energy-generation).

## Handling
Neptunium is HIGHLY [Radioactive](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Hazmat-Suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
