The Coal Generator is a type of [Energy Generator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#energy-generation).

## Obtaining
All tiers of coal generators can be crafted in an [Enhanced Crafting Table](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enhanced-Crafting-Table).

## Usage
A coal generator must be placed within 7 blocks of an [Energy Regulator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Regulator), an [Energy Connector](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Connector), or an [Energy Capacitor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitors) in a cross format (not diagonally), and provided with the appropriate fuel.  

## Tiers
There are currently two tiers of coal generators.

| Tier | Energy | Buffer |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| I    | 16 J/s | 64 J   |
| II   | 30 J/s | 256 J  |

## Fuel
Despite being a "coal" generator, this generator can also be fueled with blaze rods, wood logs, planks and other wooden items.

| Fuel                       | Burning time | Total (Tier I) | Total (Tier II) |

| Any Log                    | 4s           | 64 J           | 120 J           |

| Any Boats                  | 5s           | 80 J           | 150 J           |
| Any Wooden Slabs           | 1s           | 16 J           | 30 J            |

| Any Wooden Fences          | 1s           | 16 J           | 30 J            |
| Any Wooden Trapdoors       | 3s           | 48 J           | 90 J            |
| Any Wooden Pressure Plates | 2s           | 32 J           | 60 J            |
| Any Wooden Doors           | 3s           | 48 J           | 90 J            |

Note that it is twice as efficient to turn your logs into planks in a [Table Saw](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Table-Saw) before burning them as fuel.
