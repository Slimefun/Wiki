The Ender Backpack is part of the [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets) category.  
Practically seen this is just a Portable Enderchest.  

This item can be very useful to take with you because you don't need to carry a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment if you want to access your Enderchest on the go.

## Obtaining
This item can be crafted in the [Magic Workbench](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magic-Workbench).
