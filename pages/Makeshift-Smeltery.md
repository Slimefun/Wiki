The Makeshift Smeltery is a cheaper alternative to the [Smeltery](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery). It doesn't need materials from the Nether to be crafted.

It does lack some functionality that the Smeltery does have.

1. It cannot craft any type of [Alloy Ingots](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots#alloys)
2. An [Ignition Chamber](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Automatic-Ignition-Chamber) cannot be used
