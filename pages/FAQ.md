## I have an error/bug with Slimefun
Ok, first things first, join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/fsD4Bkh) if you aren't in it already and go to `#bug-discussions`. We need to determine if it is a bug, user error or intended behaviour.

Now, send us the following information (in the `#bug-discussions` channel):
1. Run /sf versions and send us a screenshot. We need the exact versions you are using, otherwise, we will not be able to help you.
"latest" is not helping us at all. So please run that command. (If you don't have access to this command then Shift-Right-Click your Slimefun Guide, you can find your versions in the uppermost middle slot.)

2. Check your console, are there any errors? (If so, then post them via https://pastebin.com/)

3. What do you intend to happen and what is happening?

Please also refer to [this page](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs) for a much more in-depth guide on how to report issues.

Once you've sent us all this info then one of our staff or a community member will help you. **Do not ping any role or members**. If some time has passed (15+ mins) then you may ping the helpful role (`@Helpful`). Being impatient and pinging roles/members (**especially staff**) may get you warned or kicked.

## How much RAM does Slimefun use?
You can't give an exact number or really even an estimate, we don't know your other plugins, addons, your server software, server version and we may even change things per-build which can affect RAM usage. We can recommend **at least** 4GB for any server though with or __without__ Slimefun.
