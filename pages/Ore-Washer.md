You can also place an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest) next to the dispenser to collect your washed ores. If there is no [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest), then it will be put in the dispenser.

## Usage
Most common use is to wash [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) into [Dusts](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts).<br>
Check out the Ore Washer in the Slimefun Guide in-game for more uses.<br>
To use the Ore Washer, you have to put your items in the dispenser, if there is a viable conversion possible when you right click the fence, it'll output the converted item.
