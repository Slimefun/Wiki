The Auto Breeder is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) that can be used to breed two animals automatically.

It runs on [Organic Food](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Miscellaneous-Items) which is made in the [Food Fabricator](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Food-Fabricator).  
The Auto Breeder still respects the vanilla breeding time.
