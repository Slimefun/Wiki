The Climbing Pick is part of the [Tools](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools) category.  
This tool can be used to climb up walls easier.
By default, you need to have two of these in order for it to work, one if your off-hand and one in your main hand.  
It can be enchanted with the **efficiency** enchantment to speed up the climbing process!
