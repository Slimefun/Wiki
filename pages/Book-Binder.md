The Book Binder is an [Electric Machine](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines) which can be used to combine different books together (much like an anvil would).  

## Book Binder Settings
By default, you cannot use this machine to get books above the vanilla limit.  
However for server owners it is possible to adjust this and either add a custom limit, or no limit at all.

**Tip:** Updating machine specific settings can be done in items.yml

## Book Binder Tiers
The Book Binder currently only has one tier.  
The duration of the action depends on how many enchants and what level they are.

**Power Usage:** 16 J/s
