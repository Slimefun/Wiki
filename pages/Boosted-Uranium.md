Boosted Uranium is a [Resource](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Resources) that can be used to power [Nuclear Reactors](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#energy-generation).
Out of all nuclear fuels, Boosted Uranium burns the longest and generates the most energy the fastest.

## Obtaining
Boosted Uranium can be crafted through a [Heated Pressure Chamber](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Heated-Pressure-Chamber) using 1 [Plutonium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Plutonium) and 1 [Uranium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Uranium).

## Handling
Boosted Uranium is VERY HIGHLY [Radioactive](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Hazmat-Suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
