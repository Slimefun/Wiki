Among the [Weapons](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Weapons) it adds, Slimefun introduces three new bows: the Soulbound Bow, the Explosive Bow, and the Icy Bow.<br>
They each have special properties and may be enchanted like any other Bow.

## Soulbound Bow
The Soulbound Bow remains in your inventory upon death.<br>

## Explosive Bow
Arrows fired by the Explosive Bow launch the Player or Mob they hit into the air.

## Icy Bow
Arrows fired by the Icy Bow prevent the Player or Mob they hit from moving for 2 seconds. They will be immune to freezing for 5 seconds afterwards.
