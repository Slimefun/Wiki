You can also place an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest) next to the dispenser to collect your items. If there is no [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest), then it will be put in the dispenser.

## Usage
It is used to craft many [Magical Items](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Items) and [Magical Gadgets](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Magical-Gadgets).<br>
Check out the Magical Workbench in the Slimefun Guide in-game for all possible recipes.<br>
To craft items in the Magic Workbench, you put the correct recipe in the dispenser then right click the crafting table and if the recipe was correct, it'll output your item.
