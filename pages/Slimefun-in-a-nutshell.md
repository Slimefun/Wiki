## Why should I use Slimefun?
You don't have to use Slimefun.
But it has proven itself to be a fun-addition to a lot of servers.
It enhances any Survival Experience, no matter the gamemode.

## Will there be constant updates?
Yes and no.

You will find very frequent (automatically uploaded) updates on [TheBusyBiscuit's Website](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/master/).
These are most often just bug fixes and minor tweaks.
Keep in mind that Slimefun4 is maintained by the community, not a single person or group of people.
So these updates can be very irregular.

But if you are looking for even more Slimefun-content, then you should check out some of [Slimefun's Addons](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons).
You can of course add your own content to Slimefun and make a Pull Request, it has to be reviewed and approved though.
It is much faster and also recommended to develop an Addon instead.

## Slimefun's Story
Slimefun is a Bukkit plugin that was developed by mrCookieSlime in **2013**, the goal was simple: Making Bukkit Servers feel like modern modpacks without the hassle of installing any actual mods.
At the **end of 2013** Slimefun2 was released. It featured researches, a proper Slimefun Guide, armor, weapons and many more items that helped you survive Minecraft.

One year later, in **2014**, Slimefun3 saw light of the day.
Slimefun3 had a much more technical theme, featuring miners, solar panels, electrical machines, backpacks and much more.
Many Servers jumped onto the hype, adapting this plugin for their Survival, Towny, Factions or even Skyblock Servers.
Slimefun3 was around for quite a while.

In **mid-2015**, mrCookieSlime opened his own Minecraft Server: "Cookie's Realm".
At the end of the year, the fourth iteration of Slimefun (Slimefun4) was available for Beta-Testing, exclusive for Cookie's Realm at first.
Slimefun4 added tons of new elements: item transportation, energy networks, nuclear reactors, GPS and satellite systems, little programmable androids that can mine or farm.
There is just too much to list.
This version of Slimefun was released to the public in **April of 2016**.
The source code to Slimefun4 was also made publicly available on GitHub, it is now open-source!

In late **2016** mrCookieSlime announced his retirement.
He now goes by the name of TheBusyBiscuit and pursued his interests in video game development.
Slimefun4 is still available for download and well-maintained by the public community that has been built around the plugin over the years.
TheBusyBiscuit still reviews code proposed by community contributors and does a little maintenance on the plugin here and there.
The project remained somewhat active and was maintained this way for years. [Many people](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/graphs/contributors) have contributed to the project during this time. 

In early **2019** - after getting dozens of requests about it - TheBusyBiscuit opened up the official Slimefun discord server.
This discord server quickly grew in popularity, hitting a total of 1,000 members in **January of 2020**.

During **2019** TheBusyBiscuit slowly started to get back into more active development of Slimefun, mainly focusing on code quality and performance improvements together with Walshy (@WalshyDev).
This return to development increased during the **2020** COVID-19 pandemic which caused many to stay safely at home, giving a lot of people more time to spend home as universities, schools and workplaces around the globe closed down.
In **April of 2020**, we held our first [Addon Jam](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Addon-Jam-2020) in which 6 people participated by developing their own Slimefun Addon which was then judged by TheBusyBiscuit and Walshy.
Meanwhile our discord server has reached 2,000 members at the beginning of **June in 2020**.
Slimefun is still vivid and alive and has an incredible community behind and around it.
