Plutonium is a [Resource](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Resources) that can be used to power 
[Nuclear Reactors](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#energy-generation) or to create even better radioactive fuels.

## Obtaining
Plutonium is a byproduct of using [Neptunium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Neptunium) as a fuel for [Nuclear Reactors](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Machines#energy-generation).

## Handling
Plutonium is VERY HIGHLY [Radioactive](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Radiation). Wearing a [Hazmat Suit](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor#hazmat-suit) at all times while handling them is *highly recommended*.
