Gold Dust is one of the nine [dusts](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) added in Slimefun.

## Obtaining
Crushing Gold Ore in an [Ore Crusher](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Crusher) or an [Electric Ore Grinder](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ore-Grinder) yields two pieces of Gold Dust.<br>
If you are using the [SlimefunOreChunks](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/SlimefunOreChunks) addon, you can use the same machines to turn Gold Ore Chunks from the [GEO Miner](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/GEO-Miner) into Gold Dust.

Gold Dust has a ~11.11% chance of being extracted from [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore), by processing it through an [Ore Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer) or an [Electric Dust Washer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Dust-Washer).

Additionally, crushing a [4-carat Gold Ingot](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Ingot#Gold-Ingot-4-Carat) in an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Pulverizer) produces one piece of Gold Dust.

It is not possible to convert traditional (Smelted)  [Gold Ingot](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ingot) into SlimeFun's Gold Dust/Ingot.

## Usage
Gold Dust can be smelted into [4-carat to 24-carat Gold Ingots](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Ingot) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory).<br>
It is also used in the [Corinthian Bronze Ingot](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Corinthian-Bronze-Ingot) [alloy](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots#Alloys), which can be made in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Smeltery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Smeltery).

Gold is one of the most used dusts in SlimeFun recipes, either as dust or as [Gold Ingot](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Gold-Ingot).
