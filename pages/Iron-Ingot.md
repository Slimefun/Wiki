Iron Ingots are an item in vanilla Minecraft.<br>
Although they are not added by Slimefun, the plugin offers an additional way to obtain them, and they are used in various new recipes.

## Obtaining
You can produce Iron Ingots by smelting [Iron Dust](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Iron-Dust) in a [Smeltery](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Smeltery) or an [Electric Ingot Factory](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Factory).

Iron Ingots can be turned back to [Iron Dust](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Iron-Dust) by an [Electric Ingot Pulverizer](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Electric-Ingot-Pulverizer)
