Radiation is an effect of radioactive items in Slimefun.

More specifically, it is a deadly combination of status effects you receive when carrying such items: Wither III, Blindness IV, Confusion IV, Weakness III, Slowness II, and Mining Fatigue II, for a duration of 20 seconds.

For this reason, it is highly recommended you only carry them for a short amount of time. Better yet, wear a full [hazmat suit](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor#hazmat-suit): this will make you completely immune to the effects of radiation.

## Radioactive items
The following items will induce radiation while in your inventory:
* [Blistering Ingot](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Blistering-Ingot)
* [Small Chunk of Uranium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Uranium)
* [Uranium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Uranium)
* [Neptunium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Neptunium)
* [Plutonium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Plutonium)
* [Boosted Uranium](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Boosted-Uranium)
* [Nether Ice](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Nether-Ice)
* [Enriched Nether Ice](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Enriched-Nether-Ice)

Not listed here is the [Nether Star Reactor](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Reactors), which makes nearby entities wither, but does not actually cause radiation.
