## :trophy: Addon Jams
In 2020 we started hosting our very first "Slimefun Addon Jam" on our discord server.<br>
We hope to make this a re-occurring thing. The basic premise is the following: At the start of the Jam we will announce a theme and every developer has a limited time frame to create a Slimefun Addon - from scratch - based on that theme. When the Jam has ended we will review their submissions, rate them and hand out prizes to the addons that performed the best.<br>
Here is a list of all Addon Jams that have been hosted so far:

1. [Addon Jam 2020](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Addon-Jam-2020)
