The Industrial Miners are part of the [Basic Machines](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Basic-Machines) category.  

These machines will dig up ores from the area underneath them (until they find bedrock) and will then proceed to put them in the chest.  
You have to put fuel in the chest before it is able to start working, more info on each fuel can be found in the Slimefun guide.
