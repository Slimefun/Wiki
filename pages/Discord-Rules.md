If you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/slimefun), then we want you to follow these rules.<br>
Not following this ruleset can result in being kicked or permanently banned from the server.

**These rules may change at any time, so please check regularly. Large changes will be announced in advance.**

## General Rules
These rules apply to **any** channel on the server.

### 0. Discord's Terms of Service
You are expected to adhere to Discord's Terms of Service and their community guidelines.<br>
You must be at least 13 years old to use Discord and to interact with our discord server.

### 1. No harassment
Do not harass or insult other users. You should always remain respectful towards others.<br>
Swearing itself (e.g. `oh sh*t`) is okay as long as you don't insult people or try to hurt someone with your use of language.

### 2. No discrimination
No racism, no sexism, no discrimination of any kind!<br>
We take offenses like that serious and do not tolerate any form of discrimination against our members.

### 3. No nudity or other inappropriate imagery
You are not allowed to post any nude content or other inappropriate images (e.g. symbols of hate or discrimination).<br>
Same applies for profile pictures or custom statuses.
<br>
**We will ban you from the server if your profile picture or custom status is deemed inappropriate.**

### 4. Please do not argue with members of staff
If we tell you to stop something, just stop it.<br>
You should read these rules before-hand but you may of course ask questions about the rules if they seem unclear.<br>
Keep in mind though that arguing with our staff can be a waste of time. They are there to enforce the rules, not to argue about them.

### 5. Stay on-topic!
Every channel has a specified topic.
* Questions about Slimefun? `#questions`
* You have a suggestion? `#suggestions`
* You wanna make an addon or talk about programming in general? `#programming-help`
* Wanna promote your Slimefun server? `#showcase-your-server`
* Found a weird bug that you wanna discuss to see if others experience the same? `#bugs`
* For any conversations that are not directly related to Slimefun, go to `#offtopic`

### 6. Do not tag people unnecessarily
Do **NOT** tag someone to just to get attention and do **NOT** spam tags.<br>
More importantly: Do **NOT** tag members of staff just to get a faster answer to your question..., you may be punished for this!<br>
You should not directly message our members of staff unless they explicitly tell you to.<br>
The job of our staff members is to enforce the rules and keep the server clean and friendly, not to answer every single question about gameplay or bugs.<br>
**TL;DR:** Our Staff is not your personal 24/7 support hotline, they have better things to do.
<br><br>
The **only exception** to this rule is the role `@helpful`. When asking a question you are allowed to tag `@helpful` if the question is very urgent or you have not received an answer for a while, as long as you do not abuse it.<br>
Tag this group once in your question if needed but not in every message.<br>
You can assign yourself the role `@helpful` by writing `!helpful`.<br>
This will mark you as a helpful person but also gives everyone the explicit permission to tag you when they need help, so be warned.

### 7. No Spam
Do **NOT** spam messages.<br>
* Post your message once in one channel, don't spam it across multiple channels.
* Don't send the same message multiple times in a row.
* Try to write one proper message instead of a dozen short ones.
* Excessive use of caps is also not allowed.

### 8. No Advertisement
You are **NOT** allowed to advertise products on this discord server.<br>
You are **NOT** allowed to post invitation links to other discord servers.<br>
You are **NOT** allowed to promote a fundraising campaign, giveaways, lotteries or any other means to collect money.<br>
Raising awareness for charity or non-profit-organizations is tolerated **if approved by an Admin**. Please contact us privately and state your intentions before you post it.
<br><br>
Advertising Minecraft Servers is allowed, but **ONLY** in `#showcase-your-server`<br>
IP addresses to Minecraft Servers are not allowed to be posted in any other channels of the server.

### 9. English Only
Please speak English on our discord, as that is the main language of this plugin.<br>
We are not fluent in dozens of different languages, so we will just stick with English to ensure everybody is on the same page.<br>
This also helps us to moderate the server effectively.

### 10. Other
The staff at their own discretion if there be a need can take appropriate action. 
Please have some common sense and general respect if you wish to not fall under this rule.

## Channel-specific Rules
These are short explanations of some of our channels, they also outline some of the DOs and DON'Ts.

### #questions
This is our main support channel, if you have a question, then come here to ask it.<br>
You are allowed to tag `@helpful`, when asking a question in this channel, as long as you do not abuse it.

### #bugs
This channel is for discussions around bugs, **not for reporting them.**<br>
For reporting bugs, please consult [How to report bugs](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs).

Before posting here, please follow this short guide:<br>
1. Run `/sf versions`
2. Capture the output of that command and include it in your message.
3. Are there any errors? If so, then please post them via https://pastebin.com (Posting an error in the chat will result in auto-deletion)
4. See if there is a newer version of Slimefun available. (https://blob.build/project/Slimefun4)
6. Try to be as clear as possible, the minimum is two sentences. ("X does not work" is not helpful)
7. Double-check that you are using the latest "DEV - ..." build of Slimefun. **We may not accept bug reports from outdated or unofficial versions.**

For more info on how to debug your issues and make proper bug reports, please read [How to report bugs](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs).

### #suggestions
This channel is for suggesting stuff that should be added to Slimefun or for addon ideas.<br>
If your suggestion reaches a certain amount of upvotes within a week, or one of our admins really likes your idea, then it will be moved to `#approved`.
If your suggestion is too broadly worded or reaches a lot of downvotes, it will be automatically deleted.

Try to make your suggestion as detailed as possible.<br>
"add more X" or any other suggestion that is deemed "too short" is not a helpful suggestion and may be deleted by our staff.

Try to fit your suggestion into a single message, edit your message if you forgot something.<br>
Also: Do not post multiple suggestions within the same message.<br>
Only **ONE** message per suggestion, not more or less, otherwise, our suggestions-bot will be confused.<br>
Do **NOT** post follow-up suggestions, each suggestion should be independent of another, try to contact the author of the earlier suggestion and ask him to edit his suggestion instead.

### #showcase-your-server
This channel is for advertising your Minecraft Server.<br>
Your server must be publicly accessible (no whitelist) and must have Slimefun installed.<br>
Your post must include an IP address/Domain Name of the server.<br>
The same Server must not be posted again within 14 days, otherwise, we will delete your post as a duplicate.<br>
You are NOT allowed to post a link to your discord server.

This channel is **ONLY** for showcasing your Server, any other messages will be deleted.

## Punishment
You are expected to follow our rules. Not following them can lead to us having to take actions.<br>

Most of the times we will simply tell you to stop or point out that you just violated our rules before we take any actions.<br>
Please respect this, but continuous violations will lead to a form of punishment.

### Warnings
We have a warning system in place. Severe or continuous rule violations will lead to us giving you a formal warning.<br>
Having many warnings will result in further actions from our staff, so try to not collect any of these.<br>
Warnings are permanent; Warnings will not lead to an automatic form of punishment, any further punishment will be performed manually.

If you think a warning was unjustified, then please try to calm down and ask us politely about the reason.<br>
We are also just people, we can make mistakes and are willing to hear your side of the story, if you stay calm, polite and civilized.

### Server-wide muting
Some violations may lead staff members to the decision to give you a little break from our server. People who are muted are no longer able to send messages on our discord server. Please take this break to think about your actions.<br>
All mutes are temporary, not permanent.

#### Channel-muting
Some channels like `#suggestions` and `#showcase-your-server` are strictly moderated to keep them clean and organized.<br>
Should you spam, troll around or violate the channel-specific rules in channels like these, we may permanently mute you in that specific channel.

Please adhere to the designated channel rules when posting!

### Kicking you from the Server
If we consider your profile a violation of our rules (e.g. inappropriate names, profile pictures or statuses), we may kick you from the Server.
We will also consider kicking you from the server as a final warning before issuing a ban.

## Banning you from the Server
A Ban is the final form of punishment. After you are banned you will no longer be able to join our discord server.
We will only issue a ban if we see it as absolutely necessary. 
Other forms of punishment usually proceed this. We also have automated bot-detections in place which automatically ban spam-bots from our discord server.
