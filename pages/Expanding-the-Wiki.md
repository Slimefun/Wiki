You want to help us expand the Wiki?<br>
Awesome! Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to create/edit pages on the wiki.

## Step 1: Forking the Repository
You will need to be logged into your GitHub Account for this and all the following steps.<br>
You can create a new Account [here](https://github.com/join) if you don't have an account already.

Alright, first you need to head over to [this Wiki's GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki).<br>
After that you just have to hit the "Fork" button in top right corner and you are done for Step number one.

## Step 2: Making your changes
Now that you have a fork of our wiki, you can start making your changes to it. <br>
_All changes you make to your fork will NOT affect the official wiki until you submit those changes, so please follow this guide till the end._

Now you can choose whether you want to create a new File or edit an existing File, for both we highly encourage you to follow our guidelines, otherwise we may have to dismiss your changes as invalid.

### 2.1 Creating a new page
Go visit your Fork (You can always find your fork on GitHub's dashboard or your profile page) and navigate to the folder called "pages".
![Pages directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-pages.png)

Now click on the button "Create new File".

File names have to follow the following conditions:
* File names need to end with ".md"
* File names are not allowed to contain spaces, special characters or any other weird symbols
* Instead of spaces use hyphons "-" to seperate words

Examples: "Walking-Sticks.md", "Expanding-the-Wiki.md", "Gold-Pan.md" or "Home.md".

Now you can create your page's content.<br>
The pages are written in GitHub's markdown language, the syntax is pretty easy, you can always consult [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you need help.<br>
If you need to embed images, please jump to [Step 2.3: Uploading images](#23-uploading-images).

**Make sure to save your changes by clicking the green "Commit new file" button at the bottom!**

### 2.2 Editing existing pages
Go visit your Fork (You can always find your fork on GitHub's dashboard or your profile page) and navigate to the folder called "pages".
![Pages directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-pages.png)

Now open up any of the ".md" files you see in that folder.<br>
To edit this page, simply click on the "edit"-icon.
![Edit File Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-edit.png)

Now you can edit that page's content.<br>
The pages are written in GitHub's markdown language, the syntax is pretty easy, you can always consult [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) if you need help.<br>
If you need to embed images, please jump to [Step 2.3: Uploading images](#23-uploading-images).

**Make sure to save your changes by clicking the green "Commit changes" button at the bottom!**

### 2.3 Uploading images
Go visit your Fork (You can always find your fork on GitHub's dashboard or your profile page) and navigate to the folder called "images".
![Images directory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-images.png)

Now click on the button "Upload files".
![Upload files button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-upload-image.png)

Drag and drop the images you want to upload onto the grey area and hit "Commit changes".<br>
Now you can use your image in any page using the following code snippet:<br>
```![image label](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/FILE_NAME)```<br>
Replace FILE_NAME with the name of your file (e.g. "enhanced-crafting-table.png") and give the name a short description in the "image label" field.

## Step 3: General Guidelines (Dos and Don'ts)
Whenever you edit/create pages on the wiki, follow the following guidelines.

### **Dos**
* Write interesting and detailed content
* Try to provide pictures to illustrate the topic
* Always provide an image label for your images (See [Step 2.3: Uploading images](#23-uploading-images))
* Upload images using the PNG image format
* Crop your images, users only need to see the part that is important, not your super-cool diamond block base in the background
* Still show what is important, include the whole crafting window for example, with the title and the output for example
* Use headers to structure your article
* It is fine to make one page for multiple items if they are very similar and don't need too much explanation
* Try to remain objective and use a neutral way of speaking

### **Don'ts**
* Never start your article with a header, the wiki automatically adds a header for you
* Never link to any external images, always upload your images to the images directory instead
* Never promote your server and try to remove any server-linked information from your images, no watermarks, no IPs
* Don't go too much into detail on pages about addons, this wiki is still supposed to be about Slimefun, so keep those short
* These wiki pages are obviously no place for NSFW-content, nudity, sexism, racism or discrimination

### Step 4: Making a Pull Request
Go visit your Fork (You can always find your fork on GitHub's dashboard or your profile page) and navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab.
![Pull Requests Tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-pr-tab.png)

Now all you have to do is click on the bright red button that says "New pull request".
![New Pull Request Button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4-Wiki/master/images/github-tutorial-pr-button.png)

Then click on the next "New pull request" button and fill out the description for your pull request.<br>
Please use and follow our template.

After that you click "Create pull request" and you are done!<br>
Thanks for contributing to the Slimefun4 wiki!
