The smeltery is one of the most fundamental Slimefun machines.<br>
It is not only used to smelt dusts into Ingots but also for making Alloys.

**NOTE: The smeltery requires fire beneath it. While smelting items, the fire will randomly get consumed, so make sure to reignite it when that happens.**

## How to build a Smeltery
The recipe is already found in your Slimefun Guide, but here is the final version:

You can also place an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest) next to the dispenser to catch your crafted Items.
Without an [Output Chest](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Output-Chest), the items will just land back in the dispenser.

## How to use the Smeltery
If you want to craft an Item using the Smeltery, get your items ready and put them into the dispenser (shape does not matter).<br>
Now right-click the Nether Brick Fence and you should see the Smeltery craft your item.

## Tips and tricks
Since the Smeltery's fire can be consumed every so often, make sure to either have a Flint and Steel ready or do one of the following tricks:
* Put a piece of netherrack 2 blocks under the smeltery, so the fire does not randomly go out without actually using it.
* Use a dispenser filled with Flint & Steel to ignite the fire again. You can hook it up to an Observer Block or a redstone clock to automate the re-ignition.
* Utilize the [Automatic Ignition Chamber](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/wiki/Automatic-Ignition-Chamber), which will automatically re-ignite the fire.
